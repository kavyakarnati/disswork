    "One of the great things about computers is that they are good at doing tasks accurately and repeatedly, and not getting bored with doing them -- unlike humans! As such, they are good for tackling a lot of mathematics problems that a human could potentially solve but would not really want to. For example, you should be able to solve the following pair of linear algebraic equations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2x + 3y = 8\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-x + y = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and find that $x=1, y=2$. But if you were given 20 equations with 20 unknowns, you would no doubt find it tedious and if you are anything like me, you would make a handful of mistakes in the process. It is far better that we get the computer to do it for us. That is what we will be looking at today."
